# It's time to build your first app from scratch.
# This lesson will show you how to build a user interface for your app.

# You will learn how to lay out the user interface and then add text, images, and other HTML elements to your Shiny app. 
# We'll use the App-1 app you made in Lesson 1. To get started, open its app.R file. Edit the script to match the one below:

library(shiny)

runApp("App-2")

h1("My title")
