The number of scholarships available differ by gender, with limits imposed by the NCAA.  For men’s  swimming and diving (taken together) Division I schools are allowed to offer a total of 9.9 full scholarships, whereas Division II schools can only offer 8.1 full scholarships.  For women’s swimming and diving the limits are 14 and 8.1 respectively.  These scholarships can be split into partials, with multiple student athletes receiving a portion of a full scholarship.  How scholarships are doled out is usually up to the coach. Coaches might attempt to recruit a few high powered athletes by offering them full scholarships, and give less to others, or they might distribute the scholarship portions more evenly.  In swimming Division I is generally faster than Division II, which in turn is faster than Division III, at least at the faster end.
